				<span class="newsTitle">Web UI Updates</span>
				<p class="newsBody">We're always hard at work on new features and are constantly making changes to the website. Over the last month we've added a new <a href="http://www.kflixx.com/web/index.html?tab=8">Random</a> feature that allows users to find random content based on desired filters. The random feature also allows users to keep the random item in a separate list that you can use as a source list for the random item generator by adding multiple random items to it. You can add the same item multiple times in order to 'weight' it if you wish.</p>
				<p class="newsBody">We have also updated the Watchlist feature so that we could bring back the Likes feature. You'll notice the Dislikes feature has been replaced with the Watchlist. Any existing Watchlist items will now appear as Liked items. You can find a list of your Liked items under the Favorites tab, and from here you can easily switch them back to Watchlist items by hovering over each one and marking it for the Watchlist like so:</p>
				<img src="../files/watchlist.jpg">
				<p class="newsBody">The home page has seen some updating as well; the Resume and Next Up sections have beem moved to the Resume tab in the navigation bar. The home screen now features latest items from all major content type libraries: Movies, TV, Music, Videos, Podcasts, Games and Comics.</p>
				<p class="newsBody">Introducing the first custom view types which are available at the Season level. Users can now decide if they would like the episode listing to be displayed in a List or Tiles view type by using the icon as pictured:</p>
				<img src="../files/viewtype.jpg">
				<p class="newsBody">A smarter UI has also been implemented: the tab you last visited in the Movies and TV sections will now be remembered when you visit the website again (from the same device).</p>

The library is re-scanning and should be fully re-populated by the end of the day. This problem could have been caused by a faulty hard drive, so we will be monitoring the issue closely in the near future so we can take the appropriate action if it occurs again.
